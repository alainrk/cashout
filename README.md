## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or higher
- PostgreSQL Database
- Access to an OpenAI-compatible API model, with its API Key and Endpoint (e.g. DeepSeek, OpenAI, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alainrk/cashout.git
cd cashout
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
go mod download
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Copy the example `.env` file in the project root (or set environment variables) and edit it accordingly:
Spin up local infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Database Management

Cashout uses a version-based migration system to manage database schema changes.

Use the following commands to manage database migrations:

```bash
# Run all pending migrations
go run ./cmd/migrate/main.go -command up

# Run all pending migrations with another .env file
go run ./cmd/migrate/main.go -command up -env .prod.env

# Create a new migration just by copy-pasting a previous one and editing it accordingly
cp internal/migrations/versions/001*.go internal/migrations/versions/00X_your_migration.go
```

3. For migrations that support rollback, use the `RegisterMigrationWithRollback` function:

```go
func init() {
    migrations.RegisterMigrationWithRollback("003", "Add email column",
        add_email_column, rollback_email_column)
}

func rollback_email_column(tx *gorm.DB) error {
    return tx.Exec(`ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN email`).Error
}
```

## Development

### Building and Running

To build and run the application:

```bash
# Build the application
make build

# Run the application
make run

# Run the application with live reloading (requires Air)
make run/live
```

## Run Mode

The bot can run both in `webhook` and `polling` mode.

### Webhook Mode

You need to set the relevant environment variables:

```
RUN_MODE='webhook'
WEBHOOK_DOMAIN='https://your-domain.com'
WEBHOOK_SECRET='xxxyyyzzz'
WEBHOOK_PORT='8080'
```

### Polling Mode

You need to set the relevant environment variable:

```
RUN_MODE='polling'
```

### Database Seeding

The Dev DB Seeder generates test transaction data for development:

```bash
# Set the user's Telegram ID you want to seed data for
export SEED_USER_TG_ID=123456789

# Seed the database with random transactions
make db/seed
```

The seeder will:

- Generate 5 years of transaction history
- Create 90% expenses and 10% income transactions
- Distribute transactions across all categories
- Ensure at least one salary per month
- Delete existing transactions before seeding (idempotent)
